It’s like the architects of the digital world, specialising in the creation and maintenance of seamless data highways. Just as an architect plans the blueprint for a building, network engineers determine network structures, choose the right technology components, and define the rules that govern smooth data flow. Their expertise in network protocols and standards ensures everything works together seamlessly. Moreover, they’re the digital guardians, protecting private / business data from prying eyes and ensuring its safety. In today’s tech-driven and fully connected world, Computer Networks Engineering is an essential component to keep the digital world turning smoothly and securely."

You will start by building a strong foundation in computer science and data structures, as they are fundamental to networking. Furthermore, you will familiarise yourself with the most important networking concepts, such as the OSI model, TCP/IP, routing, and subnetting both in theory and in practice. Our modern, fully equipped lab, ready to accommodate groups of 40 at a time, enables a hands-on practical experience which is crucial for this type of work.

CORE combines different perspectives by organising the whole curriculum on the key themes of market power, imperfect information and social interactions. CORE is regarded by many employers as the cutting-edge approach to economics higher education.</p><p>This Economics BSc degree provides a solid understanding of both economic theory and the quantitative methods economists use in empirical analysis. You will be introduced to real world issues currently faced by individuals, companies and governments and their possible solution from the different perspectives of the major economic thinkers of the last two centuries. The BSc economics degree is intended for those who are considering practising as an Economist in the future, in careers such as economic research, econometrics, forecasting as well as management finance and accountancy. It also provides an excellent basis for pursuing the study of economics at postgraduate level.</p><p>You will benefit from staff who are experts in their areas, which include:</p><ul><li>Banking and Finance Economics</li><li>Behavioural Finance</li><li>Monetary Economics</li><li>Econometrics</li><li>International Economics</li><li>Development Economics</li><li>Health Economics</li><li>Economic History</li><li>The Informal Economy</li></ul>",

The dissertation represents a significant final element of study where students can develop their own academic and intellectual interests. The module also allows students to develop their skills in research and independent work. The dissertation allows students to draw together different aspects of their study. They will have been required to select the topic and do the initial proposal as part of the Level 5 Research Methods for Economists module. The dissertation, therefore, represents a continuation of that work."
